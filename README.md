## Synopsis
It's food time and everyone wants to eat at QTaco!
Take orders and make the perfect taco by using awesome quantum gate ingredients!
In TaQu Fever you are the master taquero, who has to recreate what diners order. You start with a QTortilla, which is a qubit in a quantum initial state, then you apply different ingredients made of quantum gates, and what you get is an awesome QTaco, which you can see as a qubit in a quantum final state. If this QTaco is the QTaco the diner ordered, you win one point. Don't forget this is a time trial game! What will be your highest record?
